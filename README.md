# TreeLang

Very early example of a functional language, designed for describing pictures. Have a look at the `examples` directory.

Build with
```
mvn package
```

Then  execute with
```
java -jar target/treelang-0.0.2-static-dependencies.jar
```

This will read the content of the files `tree.tree` and `rule.rule` and show the result as a changing picture.
